This project used HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I used Object Oriented Programming with ES6 classes, and separated concerns between a data model and the DOM. I attempted to place most or all DOM-related activities in the View file. I did not begin with the structure of the final version of the app. Instead, I began by writing the simplest code I possibly could, a version of rock-paper-scissors that operated through the console, and iterated to gradually more complex versions of the app with each release.
